This test task was kinda strange for me.

Implementation of such simple logic can de bone in very short time, but you want to use TDD, SOLID, etc. and in the same time "Keep it simple", so i was lost for some time trying to understand what exactly you want to see result.
In the end - i still did it one commit. I'm not sure what exactly you want to split into different commits. One commit for each method like "StartGame", "UpdateScore", "FinishGame"?

I'm also not sure how can i fully implement SOLIDness for such project and keep it simple in the same time.

I have few questions regarding SOLID and TDD related to this task and would like to ask them - if that will be possible.
